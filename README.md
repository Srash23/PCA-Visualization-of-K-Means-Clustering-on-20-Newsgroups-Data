This project explores the application of K-Means clustering on the 20 Newsgroups dataset, a popular collection of approximately 20,000 newsgroup documents organized into 20 different categories. The objective is to classify the textual data into clusters that correspond to these categories. The dataset was preprocessed by transforming the text documents into numerical features using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) vectorization, which captures the importance of words while reducing the dimensionality of the data.

After preprocessing, K-Means clustering was applied, assuming 20 clusters corresponding to the 20 newsgroups. The performance of the clustering was analyzed, and the clusters were visualized using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the high-dimensional TF-IDF vectors into a 2D space. The resulting visualization reveals the distribution and separation of clusters, providing insights into the effectiveness of the clustering algorithm in grouping similar documents together.

The project demonstrates the use of unsupervised learning techniques for text clustering and dimensionality reduction, highlighting the potential of these methods in categorizing and visualizing large-scale text datasets. The results suggest that K-Means clustering, combined with TF-IDF vectorization and PCA, can be an effective approach for exploring and organizing unstructured text data.
